title: "James: your very own voice commanded servant"
---

[James](https://github.com/floere/james), the "voice commanded servant for OSX", is an amazingly fun library to have a play with. However, quite a bunch of you weren't able to get your entries in due to various reasons. Some of you didn't own a Mac, couldn't get James to understand what they're saying, or just [hate](http://twitter.com/#!/sjamesu/status/91978869699121152) speech recognition, for whatever reason.

Because of that, we only received one entry for this contest, so we decided to skip the voting period and close the contest directly after the entry period. Congratulations to Alejandro for taking first place and, of course, the contest prize (we'll contact you soon)!

### #1: Alejandro Riera

[Alejandro Riera](http://codebrawl.com/users/ariera) wrote a [James extension](http://codebrawl.com/contests/james-your-very-own-voice-commanded-servant#ariera) for his [diMLOrb](https://github.com/ariera/diMLOrb) gem, which grabs the timetables of the Metro Ligero Oeste (MLO), the tramway network of the west Madrid area. Alejandro admits that James is having a bit of trouble recognizing the Spanish names, but his entry is pretty cool anyway. After telling James your current stop and your destination, he'll tell you how much time you have left until the next train arrives.

Public transport timetables are great use for James, so be sure to have a play around with them sometime. If you have another great idea for a dialog, be sure to implement it and let [Florian Hanke](https://github.com/floere) know. He'll gladly put it into James' [example directory](https://github.com/floere/james/tree/master/examples).

Thanks for your entry Alejandro! We hope to be able to do a contest with James again, so be sure to let us know if you'd be interested in competing. Also, check out our [next contest](http://codebrawl.com/contests/terminal-admin), in which we'll be creating a database admin in the terminal.
